        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>CONGRATULATIONS! You have taken an important step in your self-care. The commitment you are making to
            self-analysis will benefit many aspects of your life, particularly decision-making about relationships. UR
            is
            for
            women who have coped with toxic, abusive or dissatisfying relationships and the impact, which can be
            long-lasting
            in surprising ways. UR is for women seeking that elusive self-love that immunizes from further harm. I
            congratulate
            you making this choice!</p>
